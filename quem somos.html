                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                         Lorem Ipsum has been
                         the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an <strong>unknown printer took
                            a galley </strong>
                         of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
                         but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
                          in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
                          Ipsum passages, and more recently
                           with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
